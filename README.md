# DatabaseProjekt
Database Project with SQLite
Used SQLiteMan and SQLiteStudio to create the database and exported it to
.sql files to be run by the program to create the database if it doesn't exist.

Game pulls info from the database to then spawn what correlates to the area.

though the "userinterface" became scuffed and lacking in structure due to time limitation.
